== Example scripts
The files in this repository are examples of scripting with ykman. Scripts can
be much more flexible and more powerful than invoking the built-in commands in
`ykman`, and can be used for programming YubiKeys in batches. For an
introduction on this type of scripting, see
link:../doc/Scripting.adoc[Scripting].

=== Running a script
The simplest way to run a script is by passing it to the `ykman` tool:

  ykman script script_file.py [args...]

You can also run the scripts with the standard Python interpreter, though
`ykman` and its dependencies will need to be available:

  python script_file.py [args...]
